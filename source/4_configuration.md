# Configuration

This section describes various ways to manipulate volplugin through
configuration and options.

## Volume Formatting

Because of limitations in the docker volume implementation, we use a *pattern*
to describe volumes to docker. This pattern is `tenant-name/volume-name`, and
is supplied to `docker volume create --name` and transfers to `docker run -v`.

For example, a typical use of volplugin might work like this presuming we have
a tenant uploaded named `tenant1`:

```
$ docker volume create -d volplugin --name tenant1/foo
$ docker run -it -v tenant1/foo:/mnt ubuntu bash
```

This pattern creates a volume called `foo` in `tenant1`'s default ceph pool. If
you wish to change the pool (or other options), see "Driver Options" below.

## JSON Tenant Configuration

Tenant configuration uses JSON to configure the default volume parameters such
as what pool to use. It is uploaded to etcd by the `volcli` tool.

Here is an example:

```javascript
{
  "default-options": {
    "size": 10,
    "snapshots": true,
    "snapshot": {
      "frequency": "30m",
      "keep": 20
    },
    "filesystem": "btrfs",
    "ephemeral": false,
    "rate-limit": {
      "write-iops": 1000,
      "read-iops": 1000,
      "write-bps": 100000000,
      "read-bps": 100000000
    }
  },
	"filesystems": {
		"btrfs": "mkfs.btrfs %",
		"ext4": "mkfs.ext4 -m0 %"
	}
}
```

Let's go through what these parameters mean.

* `default-options`: the options that will be persisted unless overridden (see
	"Driver Options" below)
  * `pool`: this option is **required**. It specifies the ceph pool volumes
    will be added to by default.
  * `size`: the size of the volume, in MB.
  * `snapshots`: use the snapshots facility.
  * `snapshot`: sub-level configuration for snapshots
    * `frequency`: the frequency between snapshots in Go's [duration notation](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration)
    * `keep`: how many snapshots to keep
	* `filesystem`: which filesystem to use. See below for how this works.
  * `ephemeral`: when `true`, deletes volumes upon `docker volume rm`.
  * `rate-limit`: sub-level configuration for rate limiting.
    * `write-iops`: Write IOPS
    * `read-iops`: Read IOPS
    * `read-bps`: Read b/s
    * `write-bps`: Write b/s
* `filesystems`: Provides a map of filesystem -> command for volumes to use in
	the `filesystem` option.
	* Commands are run when the filesystem is specified and the volume has not
		been created already.
	* Each command must contain a `%`, which will be replaced with the block
		device to be used. Supply `%%` to use a literal `%`.
	* Commands run in a POSIX (not bash, zsh) shell.
	* If the `filesystems` block is omitted, `mkfs.ext4 -m0 %` will be applied to
		all volumes within this tenant.

You supply them with `volcli tenant upload <tenant name>`. The JSON itself is
provided via standard input, so for example if your file is `tenant2.json`:

```
$ volcli tenant upload myTenant < tenant2.json
```

## Driver Options

Driver options are passed at `docker volume create` time with the `--opt` flag.
They are `key=value` pairs and are specified as such, f.e.:

```
docker volume create -d volplugin \
  --name tenant2/image \
  --opt size=1000
```

The options are as follows:

* `pool`: the pool to use for this volume.
* `size`: the size (in MB) for the volume.
* `snapshots`: take snapshots or not. Affects future options with `snapshot` in the key name.
  * the value must satisfy [this specification](https://golang.org/pkg/strconv/#ParseBool)
* `snapshots.frequency`: as above in the previous chapter, the frequency which we
  take snapshots.
* `snapshots.keep`: as above in the previous chapter, the number of snapshots to keep.
* `filesystem`: the named filesystem to create. See the JSON Configuration
  section for more information on this.
* `ephemeral`: delete this volume after `docker volume rm` occurs.
* `rate-limit.write.iops`: Write IOPS
* `rate-limit.read.iops`: Read IOPS
* `rate-limit.read.bps`: Read b/s
* `rate-limit.write.bps`: Write b/s
